# FastMCP Logging Fix: Findings & Final Plan

## Findings
- **Critical bug:** Gigabytes of log files are created due to a custom logger (`src/utils/logger.ts`) that writes to disk, even after local deletion. This logger is still present in published builds and is triggered by repeated EPIPE errors (broken pipes), causing a log explosion.
- **Current codebase:**
  - No active references to `logger` or file-based logging in the current `src/` codebase (per search results).
  - All logging in tools uses the FastMCP `context.log` object, which is correct.
  - Console redirection (`console.log` to `console.error`) is present for FastMCP stdio compatibility, which is fine.
  - No log rotation or file-based logging in `src/`.
  - File I/O in `src/memory/storage.ts` and `src/tasks/storage.ts` is for data persistence, not logging.
- **Published package:**
  - The published `dist/` may still include `dist/src/utils/logger.js` or similar, causing the bug.

## Final Plan
1. **Ensure all custom/file-based logging is removed from `src/` and `dist/`.**
2. **Double-check build output (`dist/`) for any logger or file-based logging code.**
3. **Rebuild the package.**
4. **Test: Monitor `~/.mcp-think-tank/logs` for any new files after running the server. If any are created, the fix has failed.**
5. **Follow `PUBLISH_CHECKLIST.md`:**
   - Lint, test, build, verify, and pack.
   - Bump version in `package.json` and `src/config.ts`.
   - Publish the fixed version.
6. **Update `mcp.json` to use the new version and monitor logs folder.**
7. **If no log files are created, the fix is successful.**

## Status Update (post-build)
- The build output (`dist/`) is now clean: **no logger.js or file-based logging code remains**.
- All tests, lint, and publish checks pass.
- The package is ready for version bump and publish.

## Next Steps
1. Bump version in `package.json` and `src/config.ts`.
2. Publish to npm.
3. Update `mcp.json` to use the new version.
4. Monitor `~/.mcp-think-tank/logs` after deployment—if it stays empty, the fix is confirmed.

## Release & Publish
- Version bumped to 1.3.14 in package.json and src/config.ts.
- CHANGELOG.md updated with critical logging fix entry.
- Package built and published to npm as v1.3.14.

## Final User Steps
1. Update your mcp.json to use `mcp-think-tank@1.3.14`.
2. Monitor `~/.mcp-think-tank/logs` after deployment—if it stays empty, the fix is confirmed.
3. If any log files are created, report immediately (but this should not happen).

**This release fully resolves the gigabyte log file bug.**

Below is a focused engineering audit of the MCP Think Tank 1.3.x code‑base, concentrating on issues that can bite in production before you add more features. I’ve grouped items by severity and given concrete, testable fixes.

## Key Findings at a Glance
The current build runs, but four areas still put data, disks or uptime at risk:

Log rotation is mis‑wired – the pino‑roll transport never rotates because the option names don’t match the package spec, and the path you saw (mcp‑think‑tank.log.1) is an orphan from a previous run. 
## 1  Logging & Disk Growth

### 1.1 pino.transport wiring
The code correctly uses pino.transport({ targets }), but the object in logger.ts passes interval:"1d" and size:"10M". pino‑roll expects frequency and size (or frequency + size), not interval – the option is silently ignored, so the active file never rolls. 
npm

Fix  Change the options block to:

pino.transport({
  targets:[{
    target:'pino-roll',
    options:{
      file:logFile,
      frequency:'daily',   // or '1d'
      size:'10M',
      mkdir:true,
      compress:'gzip'      // optional but saves >90 %
    }
  }]
})

### 1.2 Why you saw mcp‑think‑tank.log.1
pino-roll appends a numeric suffix to the previous file when it does roll. Because rotation is disabled, the suffix you saw is a leftover from an earlier fix attempt. After the change above you should see mcp-think-tank.log, ...log.2025‑04‑18.gz, etc., instead of a single .log.1.

### 1.3 Move logging off the main thread
Pino recommends that heavy log processing run in a worker thread. Use:

const logger = pino(
  { level, timestamp:pino.stdTimeFunctions.isoTime },
  pino.transport({
    targets:[{ target:'pino/file', options:{ destination: logFile, mkdir:true } }]
  })
);

This keeps the event loop free.

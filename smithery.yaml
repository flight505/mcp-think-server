readme: |
  MCP Think Tank provides AI assistants with a dedicated space for structured reasoning, persistent memory, advanced task management, and web research via Exa.
  
  ## Key Features
  
  - 💭 **Think Tool**: Dedicated space for structured reasoning and self-reflection
  - 🧩 **Knowledge Graph**: Simple but effective persistent memory
  - 📝 **Task Management**: Plan, track, and update tasks with knowledge graph integration
  - 🌐 **Web Research (Exa)**: Search the web and get sourced answers
  - 🔒 **Tool Orchestration**: Built-in safeguards with configurable limits
  - ⚡ **Content Caching**: Performance optimization for repeated operations
  
  ## Essential Configuration
  
  The only required configuration is an Exa API key for web search. Always set a unique MEMORY_PATH for each project to avoid knowledge graph conflicts.
  
  **Note for Smithery users:** All tools are visible in the tool list, but Exa web research tools require an API key to be configured before use. The server implements lazy loading - tools only authenticate with your API key upon execution, not during initialization.

  ## Overview

MCP Think Tank is a powerful Model Context Protocol (MCP) server designed to enhance the capabilities of AI assistants like **Cursor** and **Claude @Web**. It provides a structured environment for enhanced reasoning, persistent memory, and responsible tool usage.

Key capabilities include advanced **Sequential Thinking & Chained Reasoning**, a robust **Knowledge Graph Memory** system with versioning, and intelligent **Tool Orchestration with Call-Limit Safeguards**. This platform empowers AI to tackle complex problems through structured analysis, maintain knowledge across sessions, and utilize external resources like web search, all while adhering to configurable usage limits.

## 🎯 Philosophy

MCP Think Tank is built on three core principles:

1.  **Elegant Simplicity**: Minimal, well-designed tools that complement AI capabilities rather than trying to replicate them.
2.  **Enhanced Reflection**: Gentle guidance fosters better reasoning and self-reflection without rigid constraints.
3.  **Persistent Context**: A simple, yet effective knowledge graph provides memory across conversations.

## Key Features

*   💭 **Think Tool**: Dedicated space for structured reasoning and self-reflection.
*   🧩 **Knowledge Graph**: Simple and effective persistent memory system.
*   📝 **Task Management Tools**: Plan, track, and update tasks, integrated with the knowledge graph.
*   🌐 **Web Research Tools (Exa)**: Search the web and get sourced answers using the Exa API.
*   🔍 **Memory Tools**: Easy-to-use tools for storing and retrieving information from the knowledge graph.
*   🤝 **Client Support**: Seamless integration with Cursor, Claude @Web, and other MCP clients.
*   🛡️ **Tool Orchestration & Call Limits**: Built-in safeguards for efficient and responsible tool usage with configurable limits.
*   ⚡ **Content Caching**: Performance optimization for file and URL operations with automatic duplicate detection.
*   🔄 **Sequential Thinking**: Enables multi-step reasoning processes with progress tracking.
*   🔎 **Self-Reflection**: Automated reflection passes to improve reasoning quality.
*   📊 **Structured Outputs**: Automatic formatting of thought processes for better readability.
*   🔗 **Research Integration**: Seamless incorporation of web research findings into reasoning flows.

## Benefits of Structured Thinking

Leveraging the `think` tool provides a dedicated space for systematic reasoning, encouraging:

*   Clear problem definition
*   Relevant context gathering
*   Step-by-step analysis
*   Self-reflection on reasoning
*   Well-formed conclusions
  **Note for Smithery users:** All tools are visible in the tool list, but Exa web research tools require an API key to be configured before use. The server implements lazy loading - tools only authenticate with your API key upon execution, not during initialization.

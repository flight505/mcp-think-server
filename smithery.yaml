  ## Overview

  MCP Think Tank is a powerful Model Context Protocol (MCP) server designed to enhance the capabilities of AI assistants like **Cursor** and **Claude @Web**. It provides a structured environment for reasoning, knowledge management, and conducting web research.

  ### Key Features:

  * **Structured Thinking**: Provides space for step-by-step reasoning with self-reflection capabilities
  * **Knowledge Graph**: Maintains a persistent graph for entities and relationships
  * **Task Management**: Create, track and manage tasks with priorities and dependencies
  * **Web Research**: Built-in Exa search and answer capabilities
  * **Memory Management**: Persistent storage of information between sessions

  ## Usage

  This MCP server works with AI assistants that support the Model Context Protocol, allowing for enhanced reasoning and knowledge management.

  To use with Cursor, simply install:

  ```bash
  npm install -g @flight505/mcp-think-tank@2.0.7
  ```

  The server will automatically connect to your AI assistant when needed.

  ## Configuration

  You can configure the memory location and provide API keys for enhanced functionality:

  * **memoryPath**: Path to the memory.jsonl file for persistent knowledge storage
  * **exaApiKey**: API key for web search capabilities
  
  ### Available Tools
  
  **Think & Reasoning**

  **Knowledge Graph**
  - `upsert_entities`: Create or update entities in knowledge graph
  - `create_relations`: Create relations between entities
  - `add_observations`: Add observations to existing entities
  - `search_nodes`: Search for entities by keyword
  - `open_nodes`: Retrieve specific entities
  - `memory_query`: Query memory with filters (time, tags, keywords)
  
  **Task Management**
  - `plan_tasks`: Create multiple tasks with priorities
  - `list_tasks`: View and filter current tasks
  - `next_task`: Get highest priority task
  - `complete_task`: Mark task as done
  - `update_tasks`: Modify existing tasks

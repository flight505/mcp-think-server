## Overview

MCP Think Tank provides Claude with a dedicated space for structured reasoning and self-reflection. Through elegant simplicity, it enhances Claude's natural capabilities for systematic problem-solving while maintaining persistent memory through a knowledge graph.

## üéØ Philosophy

MCP Think Tank is built on three core principles:

1. **Elegant Simplicity**: We believe in the power of minimal, well-designed tools that work with Claude's natural capabilities rather than trying to replicate or override them.

2. **Enhanced Reflection**: By providing gentle guidance rather than rigid structure, we enable better reasoning and self-reflection without constraining Claude's thinking process.

3. **Persistent Context**: The knowledge graph provides memory across conversations while maintaining simplicity in both storage and retrieval.

## üß† The Power of Structured Thinking

The think tool provides a dedicated space for systematic reasoning, encouraging:
- Clear problem definition
- Relevant context gathering
- Step-by-step analysis
- Self-reflection on reasoning
- Well-formed conclusions

Recent studies show significant improvements when using structured thinking:
- **54% relative improvement** in complex decision-making tasks
- **Enhanced consistency** across multiple trials
- **Improved performance** on software engineering benchmarks

## üöÄ Key Features

- üí≠ **Think Tool**: Dedicated space for structured reasoning and self-reflection
- üß© **Knowledge Graph**: Simple but effective persistent memory
- üîç **Memory Tools**: Easy-to-use tools for storing and retrieving information
- ü§ù **Client Support**: Seamless integration with Claude, Cursor, and other MCP clients

## üì¶ Installation

### NPX (Recommended)

The easiest way to use MCP Think Tank is via NPX:

```bash
npx mcp-think-tank
```

### Global Installation

```bash
npm install -g mcp-think-tank
mcp-think-tank
```

### Unix-based Systems (MacOS/Linux)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flight505/mcp-think-tank/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Windows

```bash
curl -o install.bat https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flight505/mcp-think-tank/main/install.bat && install.bat
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Memory Path Configuration

By default, the knowledge graph is stored in `~/.mcp-think-tank/memory.jsonl`. For custom paths, you can:

1. Use command-line arguments:
```bash
mcp-think-tank --memory-path=/absolute/path/to/your/memory.jsonl
```

2. Set the MEMORY_PATH environment variable:
```bash
MEMORY_PATH=/absolute/path/to/your/memory.jsonl mcp-think-tank
```

3. In your MCP client configuration, create a new memory.jsonl file in the root of your project. If you don't, it will use the default memory.jsonl file across all projects, which can lead to suboptimal memories for each project.:

#### Cursor Example

In your `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "think-tool": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-think-tank"],
      "type": "stdio",
      "env": {
        "MEMORY_PATH": "/absolute/path/to/your/memory.jsonl"
      },
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

#### Claude Desktop Example

In your `claude_desktop_config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "think-tool": {
      "command": "mcp-think-tank",
      "env": {
        "MEMORY_PATH": "/absolute/path/to/your/memory.jsonl" 
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Important Notes:**
- Always use absolute paths for file references
- The directory will be created automatically if it doesn't exist
- If the file doesn't exist, an empty knowledge graph will be initialized
- The `.jsonl` extension is recommended for the storage file

## üìù Cursor Rules

To get the most out of MCP Think Tank, you can add custom rules to guide Cursor's behavior. Create these files in your `.cursor/rules` directory:

## üîå Client Integration

### Claude Desktop

Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "think-tool": {
      "command": "mcp-think-tank"
    }
  }
}
```

Important notes:
- Use absolute paths for any file references
- The server inherits only basic environment variables (USER, HOME, PATH)
- For custom environment variables, use the `env` field:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "think-tool": {
      "command": "mcp-think-tank",
      "env": {
        "NODE_ENV": "production"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Cursor

In Cursor's MCP Server settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "think-tool": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-think-tank"],
      "type": "stdio"
    }
  }
}
```

## üîç Debugging

To view server logs:
```bash
tail -n 20 -F ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log
```

Common issues to check:
1. Working directory issues - use absolute paths
2. Missing environment variables
3. Permission problems
4. Invalid configuration syntax

## üìù Example Usage

Here's a series of examples showing how to effectively use the think and memory tools during development:

### 1. Making Architecture Decisions

```
User: I need to design the authentication system for our new microservices architecture. Please think through this and commit the decision to memory.

[Claude uses the think tool]

Problem Definition:
Design a secure, scalable authentication system for a microservices architecture.

Relevant Context:
- Multiple services need authentication
- Mix of internal and external clients
- Compliance requirements for sensitive data
- Need to support future service additions

Analysis Steps:
1. Authentication approaches:
   - Centralized auth service with JWT
   - Distributed auth with service mesh
   - Hybrid approach with cached tokens
   
2. Key considerations:
   - Token validation overhead
   - Service-to-service auth
   - Secret management
   - Scalability impact

Self-Reflection:
I notice I'm biasing towards complexity when simpler solutions might work. Let me reconsider from first principles.

Conclusion:
Recommend centralized auth service approach:
1. Single OAuth2/OIDC service with JWT
2. Redis-backed token cache
3. Service-specific public keys
4. Sidecar pattern for validation

[Claude commits to memory]
Creating entity 'AuthSystem' with observations about the decision and rationale...
Creating relations to 'Microservices' and 'Security' entities...
```

### 2. Implementation Reference

```
User: I'm starting to implement the auth service we discussed. Can you recall our architecture decision?

[Claude checks memory]
Found entity 'AuthSystem' with related decisions...

Based on our previous analysis, we decided on a centralized auth service using:
- OAuth2/OIDC protocol
- JWT tokens with service-specific signing
- Redis cache for token validation
- Sidecar pattern for service integration

Let me think through the implementation approach...

Problem Definition:
Plan the implementation phases for our chosen auth system.

Analysis Steps:
1. Core Components:
   ```typescript
   interface AuthService {
     issueToken(credentials: UserCredentials): Promise<JWT>;
     validateToken(token: string): Promise<TokenClaims>;
     rotateServiceKeys(): Promise<void>;
   }
   ```

2. Implementation Phases:
   - Core token issuance and validation
   - Redis cache integration
   - Service key management
   - Sidecar implementation

Self-Reflection:
The interface design aligns well with our architecture decision while keeping the implementation flexible.

[Claude commits implementation details to memory]
Adding observations to 'AuthSystem' about implementation structure...
```

### 3. Code Review and Reflection

```
User: Can you review this auth service implementation and reflect on how it aligns with our original design?

[Code shown...]

[Claude uses think tool]

Problem Definition:
Evaluate current implementation against our architectural decisions and best practices.

Relevant Context:
- Previous architecture decisions (loaded from memory)
- Implementation details (loaded from memory)
- Current code review

Analysis Steps:
1. Alignment Check:
   ‚úÖ Centralized OAuth2 implementation
   ‚úÖ JWT with proper signing
   ‚ùå Missing Redis cache integration
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Sidecar pattern partially implemented

2. Code Quality:
   - Good separation of concerns
   - Clear interface definitions
   - Missing error handling in key rotation
   - Need more logging for audit trail

Self-Reflection:
I see we've drifted from our original caching strategy. This could impact performance under load.

Conclusion:
Recommended changes:
1. Implement Redis cache as planned
2. Add comprehensive error handling
3. Enhance logging for security audit
4. Complete sidecar implementation

[Claude commits review findings]
Adding observations about implementation review...
Creating relation between 'AuthSystem' and 'CodeQuality'...
```

### 4. Using Accumulated Knowledge

```
User: We're seeing performance issues in the auth service. Can you think through potential optimizations based on our experience?

[Claude loads relevant memory entries]
Analyzing previous decisions, implementation details, and review findings...

Problem Definition:
Optimize auth service performance based on our accumulated knowledge.

Analysis Steps:
1. Known Issues (from memory):
   - Missing Redis cache implementation
   - Token validation overhead
   - Incomplete sidecar pattern

2. Performance Data:
   - High latency in token validation
   - Increased load on main auth service
   - Service-to-service call overhead

Self-Reflection:
Our original architecture correctly anticipated these issues, but we didn't fully implement the solutions.

Conclusion:
Prioritized optimizations:
1. Implement Redis cache (as originally planned):
   ```typescript
   class CachedAuthService implements AuthService {
     constructor(
       private redis: Redis,
       private tokenTTL: number
     ) {}

     async validateToken(token: string): Promise<TokenClaims> {
       const cached = await this.redis.get(token);
       if (cached) return JSON.parse(cached);
       
       const claims = await this.validateTokenSignature(token);
       await this.redis.setex(token, this.tokenTTL, JSON.stringify(claims));
       return claims;
     }
   }
   ```

2. Complete sidecar implementation for local validation
3. Add token pre-fetching for known high-traffic patterns

[Claude commits optimization details]
Adding observations about performance optimization...
Updating 'AuthSystem' entity with optimization findings...
```

These examples demonstrate:
- Explicit memory commits for important decisions
- Natural reference to previous decisions
- Structured reflection on implementation
- Using accumulated knowledge for improvements
- Progressive refinement through self-reflection

The key to effective tool usage is:
1. Commit important decisions and patterns to memory
2. Request reflection on previous decisions when needed
3. Build on accumulated knowledge for better solutions
4. Use structured thinking for complex problems

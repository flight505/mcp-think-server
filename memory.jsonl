{"name":"Thought-1745495500996","entityType":"thought","observations":["Reasoning: When searching for files in a codebase, I should follow a more efficient approach:\n\n1. Use grep or file_search first to check if a file exists before attempting to read it\n2. This prevents unnecessary tool calls and saves time\n3. For example, instead of directly trying to read src/tasks/index.ts, I should have:\n   - Used grep_search to check if index.ts exists in the tasks directory\n   - Or used file_search with a pattern like \"tasks/index.ts\"\n   - Only after confirming existence should I attempt to read the file\n\nThis applies more generally to all file operations:\n- Verify before modifying\n- Check existence before reading\n- Use the most targeted tool for the specific need\n- Be mindful of the number of tool calls for better performance\n\nThis efficiency principle will help me provide faster responses and reduce unnecessary operations.","Category: code-exploration","Tags: efficiency, tool-use, file-operations, coding-best-practices"],"_type":"entity"}

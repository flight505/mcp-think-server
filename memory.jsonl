Research approach:\n   - I should look at Wolt's actual site to understand their design style\n   - I need to analyze the content in wolt.md to structure it into proper website sections\n   - I should identify what pages we need to create\n\n3. Content organization:\n   - Based on wolt.md, I can see we need pages on:\n     - Overpriced & Unfair Pricing\n     - Exploitation of Delivery Workers\n     - Hurting Local Restaurants\n     - Alternatives to Wolt\n   - We need both English and Danish versions\n\n4.

Content Pages Required:\n   - **Home Page**: Already started but needs more compelling content and statistics\n   - **About Page**: Explaining the purpose of the protest movement\n   - **Unfair Pricing Page**: Detailing the high commissions and hidden fees\n   - **Worker Exploitation Page**: Highlighting the gig-worker issues\n   - **Restaurant Impact Page**: Explaining how local businesses are hurt\n   - **Alternatives Page**: Showcasing better options (Just Eat, direct ordering)\n   - **Pledge Page**: Where users can commit to boycotting Wolt\n   - **Contact Page**: For inquiries, partnerships, and press\n   - **Privacy Policy Page**: Legal requirement for GDPR compliance\n   - **Danish Versions**: Of all content pages\n\n3. Design Approach:\n   - Use Wolt's cyan-blue color scheme: #009DE0 as primary\n   - Create a user flow that guides visitors toward taking the pledge\n   - Include real statistics and data points from wolt.md\n   - Add citation footnotes for all claims\n   - Implement image assets that visually represent the issues\n   - Create comparison tables showing Wolt's fees vs alternatives\n   - Design the pages to be responsive and accessible\n   - Implement language toggle between English and Danish\n\n4. Priority Content Pages:\n   - Home page with clear CTA\n   - The three main criticism pages (Pricing, Workers, Restaurants)\n   - Pledge form\n   - Alternatives finder\n\nBased on this analysis, I'll now update the todo.md checklist with more detailed tasks for content pages implementation."],"_type":"entity"}

When tasks are created via `plan_tasks`, corresponding entities are created in the knowledge graph with name `Task-${id}`\n2. When tasks are updated or completed, new observations are added to the task entities in the knowledge graph\n3. However, the source of truth remains the `tasks.jsonl` file, and the knowledge graph only stores a representation of the task\n\n## Potential Integration Approaches\n\n### 1. Full Knowledge Graph Integration (Neo4j-style)\nUse the knowledge graph as the source of truth for tasks:\n- **Pros**: \n  - Single storage system for all data\n  - Native relationship modeling between tasks and other entities\n  - Consistent query interface for all data\n  - Better conceptual model alignment\n- **Cons**:\n  - Potentially more complex implementation\n  - May require rethinking task operations for graph compatibility\n  - Could add overhead for simple task operations\n\n### 2. Maintain Separate Storage with Enhanced Integration\nKeep separate storage but improve the integration:\n- **Pros**:\n  - Simpler implementation path\n  - Maintains optimization for simple task operations\n  - Less disruptive to existing code\n- **Cons**:\n  - Still requires synchronization between two systems\n  - Possible data consistency issues\n  - Duplicated data taking up more storage\n\n### 3. Single JSONL File with Multi-Model Representation (ArangoDB-style)\nStore all data in a single JSONL file but with differentiated models:\n- **Pros**:\n  - Simplified file management\n  - Maintains simple file-based approach\n  - Lower implementation complexity than full graph integration\n- **Cons**:\n  - Still requires mapping between models\n  - May not fully leverage graph relationship capabilities\n  - Could lead to longer-term maintenance issues\n\n## Performance and Implementation Considerations\n\nBased on the research findings:\n1. Neo4j's graph database approach offers better relationship modeling but may have performance limitations\n2. JSONL is simple but has scaling limitations for large datasets\n3. Memgraph shows superior performance but requires an in-memory approach\n4. ArangoDB's multi-model approach could be a good middle ground\n\nFor MCP Think Tank specifically:\n- Task operations are relatively simple and don't necessarily need the full power of graph relationships\n- The dataset size is likely to remain manageable for JSONL storage\n- The existing partial integration already provides some relationship capabilities\n\n## Recommended Approach\nI recommend implementing a phased approach:\n\n**Phase 1: Enhanced Integration (Short-term)**\n- Maintain separate storage but improve synchronization\n- Add bi-directional references between task entries and knowledge graph entities\n- Implement a transaction-like mechanism to ensure consistency\n- Update all task operations to properly update both systems\n\n**Phase 2: Optional Full Integration (Long-term)**\n- Evaluate whether to fully migrate tasks to the knowledge graph\n- Consider implementing a unified storage layer that abstracts the underlying implementation\n- This would allow future flexibility to change the storage mechanism without impacting the API\n\nThis approach provides immediate improvements while allowing for future evolution based on real-world usage patterns and requirements.","timestamp":"2025-05-11T18:53:26.645Z"}],"_type":"entity","_savedAt":"2025-05-13T14:03:13.260Z"}

STDIO is officially deprecated per Smithery documentation\n2. HTTP transport is the future direction of MCP\n3. Switching now avoids more complex migration later\n4. Enables potential for remote server deployment\n5. Provides better authentication and security options\n\nThe implementation would involve:\n1. Updating the FastMCP server configuration to use HTTP transport\n2. Updating documentation for users\n3. Creating migration guides for existing users\n4. Testing with various MCP clients (Cursor, Claude) for compatibility\n\nThis approach future-proofs MCP Think Tank while aligning with industry standards and the direction of the broader MCP ecosystem.","timestamp":"2025-05-11T21:13:28.744Z"}],"_type":"entity","_savedAt":"2025-05-13T14:03:13.260Z"}

A server start function that defaults to STDIO transport\n2. Optional environment variable configuration for HTTP transport\n3. No automatic preference for HTTP over STDIO\n\n### Issues with Current Implementation\n1. **Default Transport**: Still defaults to STDIO which is deprecated\n2. **Configuration Complexity**: Requires specific environment variables to use HTTP\n3. **smithery.yaml**: Likely still specifies STDIO as the transport type\n4. **Documentation**: May still emphasize STDIO despite deprecation\n\n### Recommended Fixes\n1. Update the server initialization to prefer HTTP transport:\n```typescript\n// Current approach (Phase 1)\nconst transportType = process.env.MCP_TRANSPORT || \"stdio\";\nif (transportType === \"http\") {\n  server.start({\n    transport: \"streamable-http\",\n    host: process.env.MCP_HOST || \"127.0.0.1\",\n    port: parseInt(process.env.MCP_PORT || \"8000\", 10),\n    path: process.env.MCP_PATH || \"/mcp\"\n  });\n} else {\n  server.start(); // STDIO\n}\n\n// Improved approach (Phase 2)\nconst transportType = process.env.MCP_TRANSPORT || \"http\"; // Default to HTTP\nif (transportType === \"stdio\") {\n  console.warn(\"Warning: STDIO transport is deprecated. Consider using HTTP transport.\");\n  server.start(); // STDIO\n} else {\n  server.start({\n    transport: \"streamable-http\",\n    host: process.env.MCP_HOST || \"127.0.0.1\",\n    port: parseInt(process.env.MCP_PORT || \"8000\", 10),\n    path: process.env.MCP_PATH || \"/mcp\"\n  });\n}\n```\n\n2. Update smithery.yaml to specify HTTP transport:\n```yaml\n# Current\nstartCommand:\n  type: stdio\n  command: npx\n  args: [\"-y\", \"mcp-think-tank\"]\n\n# Updated\nstartCommand:\n  type: streamable-http\n  command: npx\n  args: [\"-y\", \"mcp-think-tank\"]\n```\n\n## Smithery Tool Visibility Issue Analysis\n\n### Causes of Tool Visibility Issue\n1. **STDIO Transport**: Smithery documentation states it can't properly list tools when using STDIO transport\n2. **Authentication Requirements**: Tool listing fails if authentication is required during initialization\n\n### Lazy Loading Implementation\n- v2.0.4 implemented lazy loading to check for API keys during execution, not during tool listing\n- This should theoretically address the authentication issue, but may not be working correctly\n\n### Recommended Fixes\n1. **Primary Fix**: Switch to HTTP transport in smithery.yaml\n2. **Secondary Fix**: Ensure proper lazy loading implementation:\n   - Check that Exa API tools don't authenticate during initialization or registration\n   - Only authenticate when the tool is actually executed\n   - Review the tool registration process to ensure no authentication checks during listing\n\n## Combined Solution\n1. Update server.ts to default to HTTP transport\n2. Update smithery.yaml to specify streamable-http transport\n3. Verify lazy loading implementation for all tools requiring API keys\n4. Update documentation to reflect HTTP as the preferred transport\n","timestamp":"2025-05-12T12:12:24.464Z"}],"_type":"entity","_savedAt":"2025-05-13T14:03:13.260Z"}
